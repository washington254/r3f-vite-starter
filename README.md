## Tech Stack

This boilerplate is powered by:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [vite-plugin-glsl](https://github.com/UstymUkhman/vite-plugin-glsl) - Import GLSL shaders as strings
- [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei) - Collection of useful helpers and abstractions
- [@react-three/postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-postprocessing) - Post-processing effects for React Three Fiber
- [leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva) - React-first GUI controls for creative coding
- [three-stdlib](https://github.com/pmndrs/three-stdlib) - Three.js standard library

## Shader Example

Includes a complete shader example to get you started with GLSL in React Three Fiber. The example demonstrates:
- Vertex and fragment shader implementation
- Uniform and varying handling
- Time-based animations
- Post-processing implementation
